## Build Setup
Note: If your network is slow when connecting to npm repository, please use cnpm instead of npm(check https://npm.taobao.org/ for how to use cnpm).

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at 0.0.0.0:2047, if you have run server and the server has served on 0.0.0.0:208, you can visit 0.0.0.0:2047 on browser to debug.
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
